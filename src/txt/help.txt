How to play:

Gameplay:
The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts,
a random number of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the 
lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights. The goal of the 
puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button 
presses as possible.

How to Win:

Firstly not all grid permutations are solvable.
Light chasing:
"Light chasing" is a method similar to Gaussian elimination which always 
solves the puzzle (if a solution exists), although with the possibility 
of many redundant steps.In this approach, rows are manipulated one at a 
time starting with the top row. All the lights are disabled in the row 
by toggling the adjacent lights in the row directly below. The same method 
is then used on the consecutive rows up to the last one. The last row is solved 
separately, depending on its active lights. Corresponding lights (see table below) 
in the top row are toggled and the initial algorithm is run again, resulting
in a solution.

Bottom row 	Top row
O---O 	OO---
-O-O- 	O--O-
OOO-- 	-O---
--OOO 	---O-
O-OO- 	----O
-OO-O 	O----
OO-OO 	--O--
